      <article class="blog-post-content">
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          I'm excited to share my journey of transferring from De Anza College
          to the Computer Science program at California Polytechnic State
          University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly SLO). This experience has been
          instrumental in my pursuit of a software engineering career, and I
          hope my insights can be helpful to others considering a similar path.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-mini-title">Building a Strong Foundation at De Anza</h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          De Anza provided a rigorous computer science curriculum that proved
          essential for my development. Courses in C++, Java, Data Structures,
          and Discrete Mathematics established a solid technical base and honed
          my problem-solving abilities.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-mini-title">Balancing Passions: Coaching and Coding</h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          While academics were a priority, I also remained active in my passion
          for sports by serving as a Track and Field Assistant Coach. Balancing
          coaching responsibilities with a demanding academic schedule enhanced
          my time management and leadership skills. Additionally, I gained
          practical experience as a Warehouse Logistics Specialist, where I
          leveraged my programming skills to automate inventory management tasks
          using Python.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-mini-title">
          Overcoming Challenges, Achieving Success
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          My academic journey was not without its challenges. Calculus and
          physics presented significant hurdles, prompting a brief pause in my
          studies. However, this setback only strengthened my resolve. I
          returned with renewed focus, successfully completing advanced calculus
          and consistently earning a place on the Dean's List.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-mini-title">Gaining Practical Experience</h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          My time at De Anza included valuable professional experiences. As a
          Junior Quality Assurance Analyst at Milestone Technologies and a
          Freelance Data Analyst, I applied my skills in Python, SQL, and data
          visualization tools. I gained experience leading teams in Agile
          environments, automating testing processes, and developing data-driven
          solutions. These roles enriched my technical expertise and emphasized
          the importance of collaboration and continuous learning in the
          workplace.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-mini-title">Reaching for Cal Poly SLO</h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          With a strong academic record and diverse professional experiences, I
          applied to the highly competitive Computer Science program at Cal Poly
          SLO. I was thrilled to be accepted and eager to embrace the
          university's renowned "Learn by Doing" philosophy.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-mini-title">
          Embracing Cal Poly's "Learn by Doing" Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Cal Poly's emphasis on "Learn by Doing" aligns perfectly with my
          learning style and career aspirations. Engaging in complex projects,
          such as developing scalable backend systems and cross-platform
          applications, has further strengthened my technical skills and
          prepared me for the demands of the software engineering industry.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-mini-title">Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          My journey from De Anza to Cal Poly SLO has equipped me with a unique
          combination of academic knowledge and practical experience. I am
          excited to continue my studies, pursue internships, and ultimately
          contribute to the field of software engineering as a skilled and
          innovative professional.
