          It's been quite a journey for me –- one that started on the athletic
          field and ultimately led to a passion for software engineering. While
          the path may seem unconventional, the skills and experiences I gained
          along the way have proven invaluable in my tech career.

          From Athlete to Coach: Building a Foundation
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          My early career was deeply rooted in athletics, first as an athlete
          and then as a track and field coach specializing in jumps. This
          experience instilled in me the importance of discipline, leadership,
          and teamwork –- qualities that are highly relevant in the
          collaborative world of the software development cycle.

          A New Direction: Logistics and the Spark of Optimization
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Seeking a career with more long-term stability, I transitioned to a
          Warehouse Logistics Specialist role at Milestone Technologies. This
          experience exposed me to the critical role of precision and efficiency
          in operations management, sparking my interest in leveraging
          technology for process optimization.

        <h2 class="blog-mini-title">Discovering the Power of Code</h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          To streamline my work in logistics, I began exploring Python scripting
          to automate repetitive tasks. This not only improved efficiency but
          also allowed me to focus on more strategic initiatives, such as
          leading and mentoring my team. This hands-on experience ignited a
          passion for software development and its problem-solving potential.

          Rising to the Challenge: Quality Assurance and Automation
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          My initiative in automation led to a promotion to Junior Quality
          Assurance Analyst at Milestone Technologies. In this role, I gained a
          deeper understanding of the software development lifecycle,
          collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure product quality. I
          leveraged tools like PyTest and Selenium to automate testing
          processes, significantly enhancing efficiency and product reliability.

          The Pandemic Pivot: Embracing My Passion
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          When the COVID-19 pandemic forced our office to close, I found myself
          at a crossroads. This period of uncertainty clarified my true calling:
          software engineering. Determined to pursue this path, I enrolled at De
          Anza College to formally study Computer Science. The challenges of the
          rigorous coursework only solidified my commitment and resilience.

          Reaching New Heights: Academic Excellence and Beyond
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          My dedication to my studies paid off. I excelled at De Anza, earning a
          place on the Dean's List and thus an acceptance into the competitive
          computer science program at California Polytechnic State University,
          San Luis Obispo. This achievement cemented my path to becoming a
          software engineer.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-mini-title">The Journey Continues</h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Now, as a Computer Science student at Cal Poly SLO, I'm eager to
          contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with talented peers.
          My diverse background allows me to approach challenges with a unique
          perspective. I'm excited to see where this journey leads in the
          dynamic world of technology.
